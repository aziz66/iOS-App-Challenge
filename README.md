# iOS-App-Challenge

In this exercise, the proposed challenge is to create a catalogue app that displays Items from below link.


# A few guidelines

- The app must read product data from this mocked products API.
```JSON
http://www.mocky.io/v2/59b6a65a0f0000e90471257d
```
- All products from the resource must be displayed.
- You may use any third-party libraries as you see fit.
- In case you need any help, feel free to search for reference materials on Google or ask your friends, but do not ask them to work on the challenge for you, which is obviously unethical behaviour.

# Basic requirements
For each product item, the following information should be displayed:

- Image
- Name
- Price
- Promotion status (on sale or not)
- Promotional price (if available)
- Available sizes
- The user should be able to add products to the cart
- The user should be able to open the cart, and see each added product
- You must use Swift as the main language

# Additional requirements

- If you had no problems until here, why not make the user capable of removing a product, and editing the quantities of each product in the cart?
- Don't forget to show the total payment amount on the cart!
- Was it easy until now? What about adding a filter to show only the items that are on sale (on_sale)?
- Some products lack a complete size grid (sizes are out of stock). Display only the sizes that are in stock.
- We all enjoy clean, comprehensible and testable code, don't we? This is a major plus, so refactor your code if necessary and add unit tests where possible.

# Examination criteria

- The code will be examined according to following main criterias: semantics, structure and legibility.
- Organization and comments of the git commit history will be considered.
- We're looking for an experienced Swift developer who also knows how to build a beautiful UI, so this is your opportunity to show us your knowledge in both areas.
